Titanic Survuival Prediction using naive bayes

Procedure :
=> Analyse the problem that is need to be found.
=> Collect dataset with input as age ,passanger class , gender and fare with this we predict whether people survive or not.                
=> Load dataset and summarize detials such as number of rows and columns. (Pandas).                                        
=> Map data from text to binary. If data is female mapped as 0 and male as 1.                                                    
=> Segregate the independant and dependant values.                                                                                                        
=> Identifying and replacing NA/ null values.                                                                       
=> Split train and test set for validation.                                                                                                                     
=> Use Guassian naive bayes where parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood
=> Training the dataset                                                                                                                               
=> validation stage                                                                                        
=> Observe how our model classify our new data.
